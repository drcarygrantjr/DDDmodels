function RiverPoint(vectorlengde,innQRivx, rnw_distvec, maxFl)

# Here we will adress the river UH at a certian distance from the outlet and extract the water amount 
# The RN UH is normally distributed implying that most water is at the center of the UH. This
# is at it should be since this "most water" indicates most number of river reaches and hence most erosion
# potential (most water exposed to river beds and -sides)
# delta_d is how wide are each box in the UH
# rnw_distvec the distance away from the outlet we want estimated

ant_rnw = length(rnw_distvec)       # number of points int he Rn we want estimated
rnw = zeros(ant_rnw)            # vector for storing groundwater values for the current Layer 
rnwdelta_d = maxFl/vectorlengde

for i in 1:(ant_rnw-1) #to be certain we do not go beyond the matrix 
   tall = rnw_distvec[i]
   rnw[i] = 0.0
   rnw[i] = rnw[i] + round(innQRivx[(Int(trunc(tall/rnwdelta_d))+1)],digits=3) # Integer division.  
   #println("rnw: ",rnw[i])
